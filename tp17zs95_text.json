    "text": "This lesson introduces C structures (`struct`), which are user-defined collections of variables (members) of potentially different data types, accessed by name using the dot operator (`.`).\n\nStructures can be declared anonymously or with a `tag` for reusability, allowing multiple variables of the same structure type. `typedef` can be used to create a shorter alias for struct types, removing the need for the `struct` keyword in subsequent declarations.\n\nKey features include:\n*   Direct assignment of compatible structs (copying all members).\n*   Nesting structs within one another.\n*   Creating arrays of structs.\n\nThe actual memory `sizeof` a struct might be larger than the sum of its members due to compiler-added padding for memory alignment. Structs can be passed by value or reference to functions, and also returned from them.",
