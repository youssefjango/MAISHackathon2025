Core Scenario: States A and B Bargaining over Peanut Peninsula** * **Subject of Bargaining:** The Peanut Peninsula, named in memory of Peanut the Squirrel. * **Value of the Peninsula:** Determined by four assets. * Mineral-rich mountains * Touristic site * Agricultural area * Island with strategic value * **Asset Valuation:** * The first three assets (mountains, touristic site, agricultural area) are valued equally by both states. * The island with strategic value: * Has no value for State B. * Is worth 50 utility points for State A. * *(Note: The location and value of the four assets, as well as partitions, are depicted in an accompanying figure not provided here.)* * **Feasible Partitions:** * **Current Delimitation:** Status Quo (sq) * **Alternative Partitions:** Deals x, y, and z * **Rule for Partitioning Assets:** If a partition runs through an asset (e.g., deals x and y), the value of that asset is distributed equally between the two states. * **Initial War Scenario (A vs. B):** * **Expected Outcome (p):** Equivalent to the status quo (sq) for each state. * **Expected Costs of War:** * State A: 10 utility points * State B: 20 utility points * **Assumptions:** * States A and B are rational utility-maximizers. * Information is complete. **II. Questions for the Initial Scenario** 1. **Complete the following table with the corresponding payoffs:** | Outcome | State A’s Payoff | State B’s Payoff | | :------------ | :--------------- | :--------------- | | War | | | | Status Quo (sq) | 80 | 30 | | Deal x | 50 | 0 | | Deal y | | | | Deal z | | | 2. Can any state credibly challenge the status quo? 3. Is the status quo a Pareto optimal outcome? 4. What is the expected outcome of this bargaining scenario? **III. Scenario 2: Alliance with State C (Question 5)** * **Change:** State C makes an alliance with State A. * **New War Outcome (A+C vs. B):** * Expected outcome: * State A: 140 utility points * State B: 80 utility points * Expected War Costs: * State A: 5 utility points * State B: 40 utility points * **Questions:** a. Can any state credibly challenge the status quo in this scenario? b. Is there a peaceful deal (including the sq) that is Pareto superior to the war outcome? c. What is the expected outcome of this scenario? **IV. Scenario 3: Differing Beliefs about State C Alliance (Question 6)** * **Context:** State C makes an alliance with State A. * **Beliefs about War:** * **State A's Expectation:** In the event of war, State C will honor its alliance commitment and join State A (leading to the A+C vs. B war scenario as described in Question 5). * **State B's Belief:** In the event of war, State C will *not* join State A; the war will be solely between A and B (as described in the initial scenario). * **Reference War Payoffs:** * War (A vs. B): Refer to the first paragraph. * War (A+C vs. B): Refer to Question 5. * **Questions:** a. Which peaceful deals are acceptable (i.e., preferred over war) to State A? b. Which peaceful deals are acceptable (i.e., preferred over war) to State B? c. What is the expected outcome of this scenario, and how much is it worth to State A and to State B? **V. Scenario 4: Future Power Shift (Question 7)** * **Context:** Return to the original two-state scenario (forget State C). * **New Information:** State A is in decline relative to State B. * **Expectation:** Both states expect the balance of power to shift significantly in favor of State B in the future. * **Progression:** This expected shift is believed to be unstoppable unless the two states go to war in the near future. * **Future War Outcome (if no war today):** If war does *not* happen today, a future war between A and B over the peninsula is expected to result in: * State A: 70 utility points * State B: 150 utility points * *(These values include their respective war costs.)* * **Future Deals:** Deals x, y, and z remain the only feasible deals in the future. * **Questions:** a. What payoff does State A expect to end up with, in the long run, if they do not go to war today? b. What payoff does State A expect to end up with, in the long run, if they go to war today? c. In Question 4 above, you calculated the expected bargaining outcome without considering the states’ expectations about the future. Taking these expectations into account now, complete the long-run payoffs in the following matrix (with war as the reversion outcome), and answer the question again: What is the expected outcome of this bargaining scenario? **Long-Run Payoff Matrix** | | **State B** | | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | | Maintain sq | Accept deal x | Accept deal y | Accept deal z | Go to war | | **State A** | | | | | | | Maintain sq | | | | | | | Accept deal x | | | | | | | Accept deal y | | | | | | | Accept deal z | | | | | | | Go to war | | | | | | ---",
