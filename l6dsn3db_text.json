    "text": "Here is the reformatted text, organized for clarity and without losing any critical information: --- **POLI 244 Conference 3: Game Theory Exercises** This document outlines exercises for a game theory conference, focusing on strategic interaction between rational utility maximizers with complete and incomplete information. --- **Exercise 1: Payoff Matrix Analysis (France and Greenpeace)** Consider the following payoff matrix, assuming that the actors are rational utility maximizers with complete information. France's strategies are F1, F2, F3, F4, and Greenpeace's strategies are G1, G2, G3. Payoffs are listed as (France's utility, Greenpeace's utility). | | France F1 | France F2 | France F3 | France F4 | | :------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | | **G1** | (6, 5) | (2, 2) | (5, 4) | (1, 3) | | **G2** | (5, 5) | (4, 5) | (0, 3) | (3, 2) | | **G3** | (7, 7) | (3, 9) | (4, 6) | (2, 8) | **Questions:** 1. Are there any dominant strategies for either player? 2. Find the rationalizable strategies and outcomes (i.e., iteratively eliminate the strategies that are \"never a best response\"). 3. Find the Nash equilibria. 4. What is the expected outcome? 5. Is the expected outcome Pareto optimal? 6. Complete the following graph with the missing information (six missing outcomes), and use it to determine which outcomes are Pareto optimal. * **Axes:** X-axis: France's Expected Utility; Y-axis: Greenpeace's Expected Utility. * **Given points (examples):** (G2, F1), (G1, F1), (G2, F2), (G2, F3), (G2, F4), (G1, F2). * *(Task: Plot all possible outcomes from the payoff matrix on this graph and identify the Pareto optimal frontier, including the six outcomes not explicitly listed above.)* 7. Are France and Greenpeace facing a cooperation problem here? If so, is this a coordination or a collaboration problem? How could it be solved? --- **Exercise 2: Iran and Israel - Nuclear Deterrence** Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. Israel tries to deter them from doing so by making a threat: \"If you start developing a nuclear weapon we will bomb your nuclear reactors.\" Iran does not know if Israel's threat is serious or just a bluff. **Initial Question:** Which of the two following game trees – A or B – better captures the strategic setting of this interaction? Why? *(Note: Game tree B likely involves imperfect information, meaning Iran makes its choice without knowing Israel's initial move, unlike game tree A where information is perfect.)* **Game Tree Structure and Payoffs (Common to A and B):** Both game trees depict Israel as the first mover, choosing between \"Make a serious threat\" or \"Make a bluff\". Subsequently, Iran chooses between \"Build the bomb\" or \"Give up their plan\". The outcomes and their associated payoffs (Israel's utility, Iran's utility) are as follows: * **If Israel \"Makes a serious threat\":** * Iran \"Builds the nuclear weapon\": (-1, -50) * Iran \"Gives up their plan\": (2, -2) * **If Israel \"Makes a bluff\":** * Iran \"Builds the nuclear weapon\": (-10, 20) * Iran \"Gives up their plan\": (2, -2) **Detailed Questions:** a) Interpret the four possible outcomes (in either game tree). Describe the scenario in each outcome. b) Interpret the payoffs. What do you think these values/utilities are reflecting in each case? c) Does Iran have a (weakly or strictly) dominant strategy? What about Israel? d) Use backward induction to find the expected outcome in game tree A. e) You cannot find the expected outcome in game tree B using backward induction alone. Why is that? Can you find the expected outcome in any other way? f) Represent the strategic setting depicted in game tree B in the form of a matrix: | | Iran: Build the nuclear weapon | Iran: Don't build the nuclear weapon | | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | | **Israel: Make a serious threat** | (-1, -50) | (2, -2) | | **Israel: Make a bluff** | (-10, 20) | (2, -2) | g) In the matrix above, find all the strictly or weakly dominated strategies, and all the Nash equilibria. h) In the matrix above, find the only Pareto suboptimal outcome. i) If Iran believes that there is a 50% chance that Israel is bluffing and a 50% chance that their threat is serious, what will Iran most probably choose to do? j) Iran will most likely choose to build the weapon if they believe that the probability that Israel is bluffing is *x* (or greater than *x*). Calculate *x*.",
