    "text": "Here is the reformatted text, organized according to your specified labels: --- **Plot** * **Description:** This plot illustrates two different titration curves: * Titration of weak acid CH3COOH * Titration of strong acid HCl * Both acids are titrated with 0.100 M NaOH. * **Y-axis (pH):** * Represents the pH scale, ranging from 0 to 14. * Includes a specific emphasis point at pH 7 (H=7). * **X-axis (Volume):** * Label: \"Volume of 0.100 M NaOH added (mL)\" * Represents the volume of titrant added, ranging from 0 mL to 50 mL. * **Key Points & Indicators on Plot:** * **For Weak Acid (CH3COOH) Titration:** * Equivalence point pH: 8.72 * Relevant indicator range: Phenolphthalein pH range * **For Strong Acid (HCl) Titration:** * Equivalence point pH: 7.00 * Relevant indicator ranges: Litmus pH range, Methyl orange pH range **Number** * **pH Scale Values (Y-axis):** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (H=7), 8, 9, 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 14 * **Volume Scale Values (X-axis):** 0, 5, 10, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 40, 45, 50 * **Specific pH Values:** * Weak acid equivalence point pH: 8.72 * Strong acid equivalence point pH: 7.00 * **Concentration:** * Concentration of NaOH: 0.100 M **Diagram** * Not applicable. The provided text does not contain information that describes a diagram (e.g., chemical structures, experimental setup). **Screenshot** * Not applicable. The provided text contains descriptive information and data points, not content that is typically categorized as a \"screenshot\" itself (e.g., an image or its specific visual elements). ---",

The content should be prioritized in the cheatsheet should be explanations, diagrams, examples. The following features of the crib sheet should make the sheet more comfortable to use, and should be prioritized: Compact, dense information in small text. The overall layout style should be Hierarchical outline (headings and subpoints). The font size used in the cheatsheet should be in the Medium (11-12 pt) range to ensure readability and efficiency.",
