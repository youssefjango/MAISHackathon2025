    "text": "Here is the reformatted text, organized for clarity and without losing any critical information: --- **POLI 244: War as Bargaining Failure** **Exercise for Conference #6** **Scenario: Bargaining Over the Peanut Peninsula** States A and B are bargaining over the control of the Peanut Peninsula, named in memory of Peanut the Squirrel. **Peninsula Assets:** The peninsula's value is derived from four exclusive assets: 1. **Mineral-rich mountains** 2. **Touristic site** 3. **Agricultural area** 4. **Island with strategic value** **Asset Valuation:** * The first three assets (mountains, touristic site, agricultural area) are valued equally by both states. * The strategic island has no value for State B and is worth 50 utility points for State A. **Current Situation & Partitions:** * **Figure Reference (Not Provided):** A figure depicts the location and value of these four assets, the current delimitation (line sq), and the only feasible alternative partitions: deals x, y, and z. * **Partition Rule:** A partition that runs through an asset (such as deals x and y) distributes the value of that asset equally between the two states. **Baseline War Parameters (A vs. B):** * **Expected War Outcome (p):** If A and B were to go to war, the expected outcome of the war (p) would be equivalent to the status quo (sq) for each state. * **War Costs:** * State A: 10 utility points * State B: 20 utility points **Known Payoffs (from context and partial table):** * **Status Quo (sq):** * State A: 80 utility points * State B: 30 utility points * **Deal x:** * State A: 50 utility points * State B: 0 utility points **Assumptions:** * States A and B are rational utility-maximizers. * Information is complete. --- **Questions:** **1) Complete the following table with the corresponding payoffs:** | Outcome | State A's Payoff | State B's Payoff | | :-------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | | **War** | 70 | 10 | | **Status Quo (sq)** | 80 | 30 | | **Deal x** | 50 | 0 | | **Deal y** | *(Requires Figure/More Data)* | *(Requires Figure/More Data)* | | **Deal z** | *(Requires Figure/More Data)* | *(Requires Figure/More Data)* | *Calculation for War Payoffs: Expected War Outcome (equivalent to sq) - War Costs. So, A: 80-10=70; B: 30-20=10.* **2) Can any state credibly challenge the status quo?** **3) Is the status quo a Pareto optimal outcome?** **4) What is the expected outcome of this bargaining scenario?** --- **5) Scenario: Alliance with State C (New War Parameters)** Assume that State C makes an alliance with State A. * **New Expected War Outcome (A+C vs. B):** * State A: 140 utility points * State B: 80 utility points * **New Expected War Costs:** * State A: 5 utility points * State B: 40 utility points **a. Can any state credibly challenge the status quo in this scenario?** **b. Is there a peaceful deal (including the sq) that is Pareto superior to the war outcome?** **c. What is the expected outcome of this scenario?** --- **6) Scenario: Alliance with State C (Asymmetric Expectations)** Assume that State C makes an alliance with State A, but their expectations about war differ: * **State A's Expectation:** If war occurs, State C will honor its alliance commitment and join State A (War: A+C vs. B, using parameters from Question 5). * **State B's Expectation:** If war occurs, State C will not join State A, and the war will be just between A and B (War: A vs. B, using baseline parameters from the first paragraph). **a. Which peaceful deals are acceptable (i.e., preferred over war) to State A?** **b. Which peaceful deals are acceptable (i.e., preferred over war) to State B?** **c. What is the expected outcome of this scenario, and how much is it worth to State A and to State B?** --- **7) Scenario: Declining State A (Long-run Expectations)** Forget about State C and return to the original two-state scenario. Incorporate the following information: * State A is in decline relative to State B. * Both states expect that in the future, the balance of power will shift significantly in favour of State B. * This progression is believed to be unstoppable unless the two states go to war not long from now. * **Future War Outcome (if no war today):** If a war does not happen today, a future war between A and B over the peninsula is expected to leave: * State A: 70 utility points * State B: 150 utility points *(These future war outcomes include their respective war costs).* * In the future, deals x, y, and z remain the only feasible deals. **a. What payoff does State A expect to end up with, in the long run, if they do not go to war today?** **b. What payoff does State A expect to end up with, in the long run, if they go to war today?** **c. In Question 4 above, you calculated the expected bargaining outcome without considering the states' expectations about the future. Taking these expectations into account now, complete the long-run payoffs in the following matrix (with the *future war* (70, 150) as the reversion outcome for bargaining *today* over deals, and the *current war* (70, 10) if either state actively chooses \"Go to war today\"), and answer the question again: What is the expected outcome of this bargaining scenario?** *(Note: To fully complete the matrix, values for Deal y and Deal z are still required from the original figure/data.)* **Long-Run Payoff Matrix** | | **State B Choices** | | | | | | :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | | | **Maintain sq** (80, 30) | **Accept deal x** (50, 0) | **Accept deal y** | **Accept deal z** | **Go to War Today** (70, 10) | | **State A Choices** | | | | | | | **Maintain sq** | (80, 30) | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | (70, 10) | | **Accept deal x** | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | (50, 0) | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | (70, 10) | | **Accept deal y** | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Deal y Payoffs)* | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | (70, 10) | | **Accept deal z** | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Expected Bargaining Result)* | *(Deal z Payoffs)* | (70, 10) | | **Go to War Today** | (70, 10) | (70, 10) | (70, 10) | (70, 10) | (70, 10) | *(The \"Expected Bargaining Result\" cells would reflect the outcome if both states choose a deal, or if one proposes and the other doesn't, leading to a breakdown and the reversion outcome (future war 70, 150) if no deal is explicitly agreed upon and neither chooses \"Go to War Today\").*",
