    "text": "In C, structs (structures) are user-defined data types that group a collection of items, called members, of potentially different types. Unlike arrays, members are accessed by name using the dot operator (`.`).\n\nStructs can be declared anonymously or with a *tag* (e.g., `struct TAG { member_declarations; };`) to define a reusable type. Variables of a tagged struct are declared as `struct TAG variable;`. The `typedef` keyword is often used to create an alias, allowing declaration without the `struct` keyword (e.g., `typedef struct { ... } NewTypeName; NewTypeName variable;`).\n\nKey features:\n*   Members are declared inside the struct but cannot be initialized there.\n*   Structs can be assigned using the `=` operator, which performs a member-by-member copy.\n*   Structs can be *nested*, meaning a struct can contain other structs as members, accessed with chained dot operators.\n*   Arrays of structs are supported.\n*   Structs can be passed to and returned from functions.\n*   The `sizeof` a struct may be larger than the sum of its members due to compiler-added padding for memory alignment.",
