The actors are rational utility maximizers with complete information. **Players and Strategies:** * **Greenpeace (Row Player):** Strategies G1, G2, G3 * **France (Column Player):** Strategies F1, F2, F3, F4 **Payoff Matrix:** (Payoffs are listed as (Greenpeace's utility, France's utility)) | | **F1** | **F2** | **F3** | **F4** | | :------ | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | | **G1** | 6, 5 | 2, 2 | 5, 4 | 1, 3 | | **G2** | 5, 5 | 4, 5 | 0, 3 | 3, 2 | | **G3** | 7, 7 | 3, 9 | 4, 6 | 2, 8 | **Questions:** 1. Are there any dominant strategies? 2. Find the rationalizable strategies and outcomes (i.e., iteratively eliminate the strategies that are “never a best response”). 3. Find the Nash equilibria. 4. What is the expected outcome? 5. Is the expected outcome Pareto optimal? 6. Complete the following graph with the missing information (six missing outcomes), and use it to determine which outcomes are Pareto optimal. * **Graph Axes:** Y-axis: France's expected utility; X-axis: Greenpeace's expected utility. * **Given Outcomes:** (G2, F1), (G1, F1), (G2, F2), (G2, F3), (G2, F4), (G1, F2) * *(Note: The graph is not provided in the text, only the instructions for it.)* 7. Are France and Greenpeace facing a cooperation problem here? If so, is this a coordination or a collaboration problem? How could it be solved? --- ### **Exercise 2: Sequential Game with Incomplete Information** **Context:** Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. Israel tries to deter them by making a threat: “If you start developing a nuclear weapon we will bomb your nuclear reactors.” Iran does not know if Israel’s threat is serious or just a bluff. Iran has to make a choice between carrying out their original plan and building the bomb, or giving up their plan. **Problem Statement:** Which of the two following game trees – A or B – better captures the strategic setting of this interaction? Why? **Game Trees (A and B):** Both game trees are structurally identical and show the following sequence and payoffs (Payoffs are listed as (Iran's utility, Israel's utility)): * **Tree Structure:** * **Root (Israel):** Israel makes an initial \"choice\" or represents a \"type\" (e.g., serious threat or bluff). * **Branch 1 (Israel's \"Serious Threat\" / Type 1):** Leads to Iran's decision. * **Iran Chooses \"Build nuclear weapon\":** Outcome (-1, -50) * **Iran Chooses \"Don't build nuclear weapon\":** Outcome (2, -2) * **Branch 2 (Israel's \"Bluff\" / Type 2):** Leads to Iran's decision. * **Iran Chooses \"Build nuclear weapon\":** Outcome (-10, 20) * **Iran Chooses \"Don't build nuclear weapon\":** Outcome (2, -2) * **Assumption for Question 'e':** Game tree B will be treated as a game of incomplete information, meaning Iran's two decision nodes (after Israel's initial \"choice\" or \"type\") are part of the same information set, as Iran doesn't know Israel's true resolve. **Questions:** a) Interpret the four possible outcomes (in either game tree). Describe the scenario in each outcome. b) Interpret the payoffs. What do you think these values/utilities are reflecting in each case? c) Does Iran have a (weakly or strictly) dominant strategy? What about Israel? d) Use backward induction to find the expected outcome in game tree A. *(Assumes game tree A is a game of complete information where Iran knows Israel's initial choice/type.)* e) You cannot find the expected outcome in game tree B using backward induction alone. Why is that? Can you find the expected outcome in any other way? *(Confirms game tree B is a game of incomplete information.)* f) Represent the strategic setting depicted in game tree B in the form of a matrix. **Matrix Representation of Game Tree B:** (Payoffs are listed as (Iran's utility, Israel's utility)) | | **Israel: Make a serious threat** | **Israel: Make a bluff** | | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------- | | **Iran: Build the nuclear weapon** | (-1, -50) | (-10, 20) | | **Iran: Don't build the nuclear weapon** | (2, -2) | (2, -2) | g) In the matrix above, find all the strictly or weakly dominated strategies, and all the Nash equilibria. h) In the matrix above, find the only Pareto suboptimal outcome. i) If Iran believes that there is a 50% chance that Israel is bluffing and a 50% chance that their threat is serious, what will Iran most probably choose to do? j) Iran will most likely choose to build the weapon if they believe that the probability that Israel is bluffing is *x* (or greater than *x*). Calculate *x*.",
