    "text": "This text introduces **C structures (`struct`)**, which are user-defined data types allowing the grouping of a collection of items (called members) that can be of different data types into a single unit. Unlike arrays, struct members are accessed by their name using the **dot operator (`.`)**.\n\nStructures can be declared anonymously or with a **tag** (e.g., `struct PERSON { ... };`) to facilitate declaring multiple variables of the same structure type throughout the code, avoiding repetitive definitions. Members cannot be initialized directly within the structure definition.\n\nKey features include:\n*   **Assignment:** Entire structs can be assigned to compatible structs using the `=` operator, copying all member values (a feature not available directly for arrays).\n*   **Nesting:** Structures can contain other structures as members.\n*   **Arrays of Structs:** Arrays can be created where each element is a structure.\n*   **Typedef:** Often used to create an alias for a structure type (e.g., `typedef struct { ... } Person;`), simplifying variable declarations by removing the need for the `struct` keyword.\n\nImportant memory consideration: the `sizeof` a struct may be larger than the sum of its members' sizes due to **padding** added by the compiler for memory alignment. Structures can be passed by value or by reference to functions and can also be returned.",
