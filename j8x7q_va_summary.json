    "text": "This text describes three distinct basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops, each originating from and projecting back to specific frontal cortical areas, and differentially involving the striatum, pallidum, and thalamus:\n\n*   **Body movement loop:** Links primary/premotor/supplementary motor cortex with the putamen, specific globus pallidus/substantia nigra pars reticulata, and ventral lateral/anterior thalamic nuclei for motor control.\n*   **Prefrontal loop:** Connects the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the anterior caudate, globus pallidus/substantia nigra pars reticulata, and mediodorsal/ventral anterior thalamic nuclei, mediating cognitive functions.\n*   **Limbic loop:** Involves the anterior cingulate/orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, influencing emotion and motivation and targeting broader limbic areas.",
