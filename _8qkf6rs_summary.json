(e.g., `puts(\"Freshman: \");`) * `getc()`: Reads a single character from a specified input stream. In this case, `stdin` (standard input, usually the keyboard) is used. (e.g., `c = getc(stdin);`) 2. **`int main(void)`** * **`main` function**: This is the mandatory entry point of every C program. An application starts its execution here. * **`int`**: This specifies the return type of the `main` function. The `main` function always returns an integer, which serves as an exit status or error code to the operating system (0 typically indicates successful execution). * **`void`**: This indicates that the `main` function does not take any arguments. (Functions can be designed to accept arguments, which will be covered in more detail in other contexts.) 3. **Variable Declaration and Usage** * **`char c;`**: * **Declaring variables**: This line declares a variable named `c` of type `char`. Declaring a variable reserves a specific amount of memory for it, based on its type. * **`puts(\"Freshman: \");`**: * This line uses the `puts` function to display a prompt string to the user. * **`c = getc(stdin);`**: * **Using variables**: This line reads a single character from the standard input (`stdin`) and assigns it to the `c` variable. 4. **Conditional Statement (`if-else`)** * **`if (c == 'Y' || c == 'y')`**: This is a conditional statement that checks if the character stored in the variable `c` is either an uppercase 'Y' OR a lowercase 'y'. * **`puts(\"Welcome\\n\");`**: If the condition in the `if` statement is true, this message is printed. * **`else`**: If the condition in the `if` statement is false. * **`puts(\"Sorry, try again.\\n\");`**: This message is printed. 5. **`return 0;`** * This statement exits the `main` function. The value `0` is returned to the operating system, indicating that the program executed successfully without any errors.",
