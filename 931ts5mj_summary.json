    "text": "The diagram illustrates three parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops, each connecting specific frontal cortical areas to the striatum, pallidum, and thalamus, before projecting back to the cortex, specializing in different functions:\n\n1.  **Body Movement Loop:** Involves primary motor, premotor, and somatosensory cortex, projecting to the **putamen**, globus pallidus, and ventral lateral/anterior thalamus, for motor control.\n2.  **Prefrontal Loop:** Involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, projecting to the **anterior caudate**, globus pallidus/substantia nigra pars reticulata, and mediodorsal/ventral anterior thalamus, for executive functions.\n3.  **Limbic Loop:** Involves the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex (and other limbic structures like amygdala/hippocampus), projecting to the **ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens)**, ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, for emotion and motivation.",
