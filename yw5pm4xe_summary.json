    "text": "This text illustrates three parallel neural loops – Body Movement, Prefrontal, and Limbic – that connect the frontal cortex, basal ganglia (striatum and pallidum), and thalamus, before returning to specific cortical targets.\n\nEach loop originates from a distinct frontal cortical region (motor/premotor, dorsolateral prefrontal, or anterior cingulate/orbitofrontal respectively) and proceeds through specific subregions of the striatum, pallidum, and thalamus. They ultimately project back to cortical areas mediating motor control, executive function, or emotion/motivation, respectively.",
